    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-US/">League of Legends</a> is a popular <em>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</em> (MOBA) published by Riot Games. It features a highly-competitive scene, and two persistent game modes, Summoner's Rift and Howling Abyss.</p>
    <h2>Summoner's Rift</h2>
    <p>This gamemode features two teams clashing. To win, one team must push into the other team's base and destroy their nexus. Obstacles to this goal include the enemy team themselves, as well as turrets that obstruct the path into the enemy base. Each team has several positions to fill:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Toplaner</strong>. Typically a tank champion. As the name implies, they take top lane. </li>
        <li><strong>Midlaner</strong>. Typically a ranged champion or assassin. They take midlane.</li>
        <li><strong>ADC</strong>. Typically a physical ranged champion. They take botlane.</li>
        <li><strong>Support</strong>. Typically a mage or tank. They take botlane with the ADC, but do not farm minions. Typically, they do not need much gold in order to scale, but they can make extra through helping kill enemy botlaners.</li>
        <li><strong>Jungler</strong>. This role roams the jungle between lanes, killing neutral mobs and ambushing unaware enemy champions to help their team get ahead.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Howling Abyss</h2>
    <p>This game mode only features one lane. Champions are also selected randomly. This gamemode essentially boils down to pure teamfighting.</p>
